### Step 1: Create Project and QMD File

I created a new RStudio Project named `git-demo`. Within this project folder, I creaded a file called `example.qmd` that can be knitted into a HTML file.

### Step 2: Synchronize Local Repository with GitHub

In this step, I connected my local RStudio project to a new GitHub repository and successfully pushed my initial commit.

1.  I opened the Terminal in RStudio and ran the following commands to initialize the repository, track all files, and commit them:

    ```         
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

2.  I created a new repository on GitHub named `git-demo`. Then, I connected my local project to it using the SSH URL:

    ```         
    git remote add origin git@github.com:RuoWei-ctrl/git-demo.git
    ```

3.  Since GitHub may already contain a `README.md`, I pulled and rebased any remote changes first:

    ```         
    git pull --rebase origin main
    ```

    Then I pushed my local commit to GitHub and set the upstream:

    ```         
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After this step, my RStudio project was successfully synchronized with the `git-demo` repository on GitHub, and all files were under version control.
